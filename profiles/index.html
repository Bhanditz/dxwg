      I should still also try to go through and incorporate material that the group agrees to in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/ProfileRoundup">Profile Roundup</a>, <a href="https://github
      .com/w3c/dxwg/issues/196">Issue 196</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/323">Issue 323</a> (for better articulation with the documentation for the prof-o).

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
	<div class="note">(Antoine:) I feel Nick's intro can be re-worked/completed (for example mentioning <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">DWBP</a>). But for now I'm keeping it, as I think it is correct and works well as introductory material
	</div>
    <div class="note"><p>(Peter) I think that we need to reflect on the word 'profile' at the beginning... I'm just popping this in as an idea ...something like:</p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic;">A profile is generally understood as being the outline of the margin of some thing when seen from a specific point of view.  Profiling is also the task of distilling the essential aspects or character of something, such as a person, from a specific angle.  Also, in the craft domain, a profile is taken by a tool that matches itself in detail to the contours of a 3-dimensional object and returns a 2-dimensional accurate representation from which other formable materials can be constrained and fashioned to that profile, or matched with it to determine how accurately it portrays the original 3-dimensional object from which the profile was taken.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic;">In the same sense then, information entities can be viewed from different perspectives and in order to prepare them for specific uses they are frequently tested for their goodness of fit to some pattern, or the pattern can be provided prior to the gathering of the information to provide some constraint to ensure adequacy and appropriateness of that information asset to the job in hand.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style:italic;">How should we describe this profiling tool for information?  In the physical domain we can profile with a paper cutout in the simple case, or with a laser in the technologically more complex case.  Is this the same with information assets?</span></p>  
    </div>
    <p>
      Builders of vocabularies and ontologies are encouraged to make their
      work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future
      adoption. As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a
      data model using minimal semantics. For example, DCAT [[vocab-dcat-2]] defines the
      concept of a <em>dataset</em> as an abstract entity with <em>distributions</em> and <em>data services</em>
      as means of accessing data. It is silent on whether a
      distribution should be in a particular serialization, or set of
      serializations; it is silent on how data services should be configured;
      while it states that the value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS concept,
      it does not specify a particular SKOS [[skos-reference]] concept scheme, and so on. Other
      vocabularies such as Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]] are equally parsimonious in their prescriptions of how they
      should be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is good practice: it means that data models and methods of working
      can be applied in different circumstances than those in which the original
      definition work was carried out and, in that sense, promotes broad
      interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, any individual system will be designed to meet a specific set
      of needs, that is, it will operate in a specific context. It is that
      context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within
      it, that will determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be
      used. For example, a system ingesting data may require that a specific
      subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only
      terms from a defined code list are used as values for specified
      properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the
      value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialised <em>profile</em>
      will say "the value of this property MUST be from <em>this</em> specific code list".
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is about how to formulate and communicate <em>profiles</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) Nick suggested to reuse some elements of the F2F3 outline as a 'motivation' section. I believe the following ones could be mentioned in intro:
		<ul>
			<li>Communities, national identity on data standards, domains of activity</li>
			<li>Functions: consensus; sharing; search; etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">(Antoine:) From https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364:
		<ul>
			<li>A profile SHOULD have a textual description intended for humans</li>
			<li>A profile SHOULD describe metadata elements/properties</li>

    <div class="note">(Antoine:) Though it should likely be formatted differently, I see this section as reprising Nick's idea in sections 5.2 and 5.3 at
https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/blob/a7403b8c3ceb2630a1a1eb87da7b9babc6fd2d7e/profiles/index.html (i.e. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiles/#description">here</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiles/#functions">here</a> in the version of 15 Sept 2018). I.e. list some of the DXWG requirements on profile and explain how they translate in recommendations, when needed.</div>
    
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) At this stage I have doubts on whether all requirements should be reflected in this section. Perhaps we should have only two clusters for the requirements about administrative and descriptive metadata in this section and detail them later, in the section about that metadata.</div>

    <div class="issue" data-number="365">
      (Antoine:) I think the URI requirements fits here. In fact I think this section should be the one that acts as a 'cover/teaser' for our conneg doc. I.e. it gives a brief motivation for it, tries to fit it in our general picture/model and point to it as our recommendation
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      (Antoine:) To make this section work, I think it will be good if the reader can see our 'big picture' on profiles and their possible (or recommended) components. I'm thinking of something at the level of the diagram at https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1dHkpwKwUwMgS1RqSCTPO3uOoRiY_qNk0z5bhXJlYi4Y/, which should work as an abstracted version of the prof-o model https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profilesont/ (i.e. one without classes and properties that come from a specific namespace/vocabulary. NB: at this stage I'm not sure if this diagram would fit better in this section or in the one above ('What is a profile?').

      <em>profiling</em> is an activity that has been undertaken by many communities with a range of formalisms.

      (Antoine:) This section was recommended here in https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364. I now have doubts about the it, as it breaks the flow between two crucial (normative) sections on DXWG recommendations. As an alternative, I suggest to try to fit this in (a subsection of) the introduction if it can be short enough. Otherwise we could put it as appendix and refer to it from the introduction.
    </div>
    <div class="issue" data-number="419"></div>
    <div class="note">
      (Karen:) I had thought of this as showing examples of TYPES of profiles. There are profiles like DCAT that take place within a community, make primary use of a base metadata schema, but add or remove based on local need. There are profiles like ODRL that have a very formal meaning (legal license) and are in essence cumulative, with the base standard elements assumed and specific rules for over-riding. There are profiles that use only the namespace of the base profile, but are defined subsets (BIBFRA.ME, but any other example of this would be fine - that's the one I know). And then we could perhaps find a profile that has no strong base profile (ADMS perhaps?) but combines elements as needed from a variety of sources and is independent of any existing vocabulary. The idea would be to show a range of profile motivations, designs, and community involvement.

    <h2>The Profiles ontology</h2>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <div class="note">
      (Antoine:) What I have in mind for this section is to introduce the DXWG Profiles ontology. Say how it can support the requirements we identified, point to it, and suggest to use in contexts where an RDF / Linked Data description of the profiles and their associated resources can be made. If it's non-normative, it should be presented as a possible approach to implementing our recommendations, for example using a sentence like <i>The machine-readable version of the metadata on profiles and their links to associated resources may be provided using the Profiles ontology developed by the DXWG working group</i> (shamelessly inspired from how we've done it in the DWBP doc at https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality). I guess it should also reprise some points made at https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/323.

  <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples of applying these recommendations</h2>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) The idea here would be to point to examples that follow our recommendations, made up to illustrate specific features, or complete 'real' implementations. Ideally these would be using prof-o, on the condition that we still refer to prof-o as a suggestion not a formal recommendation (see the way it's been mentioned above). I reckon that some may find it more natural to have fully fledged</div>
    <div class="issue" data-number="370">
      (Antoine:) Some may prefer to have fully fledged examples in prof-o in prof-o's own documentation. I do think there is value in having at least some examples here, even if as a result we decide that the prof-o documentation would be a 'pure' namespace doc like this one for SKOS: https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Builders of vocabularies and ontologies are encouraged to make their
      work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future
      adoption. As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a
      data model using minimal semantics. For example, DCAT [[vocab-dcat-2]] defines the
      concept of a <em>dataset</em> as an abstract entity with <em>distributions</em> and <em>data services</em>
      as means of accessing data. It is silent on whether a
      distribution should be in a particular serialization, or set of
      serializations; it is silent on how data services should be configured;
      while it states that the value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS concept,
      it does not specify a particular SKOS [[skos-reference]] concept scheme, and so on. Other
      vocabularies such as Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]] are equally parsimonious in their prescriptions of how they
      should be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is good practice: it means that data models and methods of working
      can be applied in different circumstances than those in which the original
      definition work was carried out and, in that sense, promotes broad
      interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, any individual system will be designed to meet a specific set
      of needs, that is, it will operate in a specific context. It is that
      context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within
      it, that will determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be
      used. For example, a system ingesting data may require that a specific
      subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only
      terms from a defined code list are used as values for specified
      properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the
      value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialised <em>profile</em>
      will say "the value of this property MUST be from <em>this</em> specific code list".
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is about how to formulate and communicate <em>profiles</em>.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>
      A profile is generally understood as representing a point of view. In information technology, profiles may also
      support the data needs of specific applications. Profiling is often the work of a community interested in
      interoperability and data exchange. We define a profile generally as named set of constraints on one or more
      identified base specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communities create and use data standards to ensure interoperability for information exchange. Although members
      of a community may use the same basic standard schema, it is very common for different subsets within the larger
      community to need some further specification of the data they create to meet their own needs. To continue to
      support interoperability of their data with others, these community members need to express the specifics of
      their implementation of the data schema. Profiles serve this purpose. Profiles enumerate vocabulary terms,
      cardinality, and validation rules, and can also include descriptions of the rules used by creators to make
      decisions regarding their data elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good metadata practice begins with the builders of vocabularies and ontologies. Builders of vocabularies and
      ontologies are encouraged to make their work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future adoption.
      As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a data model using minimal semantics. For example,
      DCAT [[vocab-dcat-2]] defines the concept of a dataset as an abstract entity with distributions and data services
      as means of accessing data; it is silent on whether a distribution should be in a particular serialization, or
      set of serializations. It is also silent on how data services should be configured. While it states that the
      value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS [[skos-reference]] concept, it does not specify a particular SKOS concept
      scheme, and so on. Other vocabularies, such as Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]], are equally parsimonious in their
      prescriptions of how they should be used. This means that data models and methods of working can be applied in
      different circumstances than those in which the original definition work was carried out and, in that sense,
      these promote broad interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to addressing the needs of a specific community, a profile may also apply to a single system. Any
      individual system will be designed to meet a specific set of needs; that is, it will operate in a specific
      context. It is that context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within it, that will
      determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be used. For example, a system ingesting data may require
      that a specific subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only terms from a defined code
      list are used as values for specified properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the
      value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialized profile will say "the value of
      this property MUST be from this specific code list".
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is about how to formulate and communicate profiles.

    <div class="note">(Antoine:) Nick suggested to reuse some elements of the F2F3 outline as a 'motivation' section. I believe the following ones could be mentioned in intro:
		<ul>
			<li>Communities, national identity on data standards, domains of activity</li>
			<li>Functions: consensus; sharing; search; etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Related work and examples of existing profiles</h4>
    <p>
      <em>profiling</em> is an activity that has been undertaken by many communities with a range of formalisms.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      (Karen:) I had thought of this as showing examples of TYPES of profiles. There are profiles like DCAT that take place within a community, make primary use of a base metadata schema, but add or remove based on local need. There are profiles like ODRL that have a very formal meaning (legal license) and are in essence cumulative, with the base standard elements assumed and specific rules for over-riding. There are profiles that use only the namespace of the base profile, but are defined subsets (BIBFRA.ME, but any other example of this would be fine - that's the one I know). And then we could perhaps find a profile that has no strong base profile (ADMS perhaps?) but combines elements as needed from a variety of sources and is independent of any existing vocabulary. The idea would be to show a range of profile motivations, designs, and community involvement.

    <h2>What is a profile?</h2>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) From https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364:
		<ul>
			<li>A profile SHOULD have a textual description intended for humans</li>
			<li>A profile SHOULD describe metadata elements/properties</li>
			<li>A profile SHOULD describe valid value types for elements</li>
			<li>A profile SHOULD provide relevant cardinality rules</li>
			<li>(etc. here until we finalize requirements - these are just examples)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="note">(Antoine:) Though it should likely be formatted differently, I see this section as reprising the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/blob/a7403b8c3ceb2630a1a1eb87da7b9babc6fd2d7e/profiles/index.html">previous structure</a>'s <em>description</em> & <em>functions</em> sections (see id="description" &amp; id="functions" in the HTML) i.e. list some of the DXWG requirements on profile and explain how they translate in recommendations, when needed.</div>
    
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) At this stage I have doubts on whether all requirements should be reflected in this section. Perhaps we should have only two clusters for the requirements about administrative and descriptive metadata in this section and detail them later, in the section about that metadata.</div>

    <div class="note">
      (Antoine:) To make this section work, I think it will be good if the reader can see our 'big picture' on profiles and their possible (or recommended) components. I'm thinking of something at the level of the diagram at https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1dHkpwKwUwMgS1RqSCTPO3uOoRiY_qNk0z5bhXJlYi4Y/, which should work as an abstracted version of the prof-o model https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profilesont/ (i.e. one without classes and properties that come from a specific namespace/vocabulary. NB: at this stage I'm not sure if this diagram would fit better in this section or in the one above ('What is a profile?').

  <section id="metadata">
    <h2>Administrative and descriptive metadata</h2>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) From https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364, Administrative metadata:
		<ul>
			<li>A profile MUST have URI (or an IRI?) identifying it. The URI SHOULD be an http URI</li>
			<li>creator/maintainer (+ contact info)</li>
			<li>date/version</li>
			<li>etc</li>
			<li></li>
    </ul>
    </div>
   <div class="note">(Antoine:) I've kept it here, but I do agree with the comment at  https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364 (and above) that URI should be in a specific section on publication of profiles.</div>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) From https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/242#issuecomment-408916364, Descriptive metadata:
		<ul>

    <h2>The Profiles ontology</h2>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <div class="note">
      (Antoine:) What I have in mind for this section is to introduce the DXWG Profiles ontology. Say how it can support the requirements we identified, point to it, and suggest to use in contexts where an RDF / Linked Data description of the profiles and their associated resources can be made. If it's non-normative, it should be presented as a possible approach to implementing our recommendations, for example using a sentence like <i>The machine-readable version of the metadata on profiles and their links to associated resources may be provided using the Profiles ontology developed by the DXWG working group</i> (shamelessly inspired from how we've done it in the DWBP doc at https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality). I guess it should also reprise some points made at https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/323.

  <section id="examples">
    <h2>Examples of applying these recommendations</h2>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <div class="note">(Antoine:) The idea here would be to point to examples that follow our recommendations, made up to illustrate specific features, or complete 'real' implementations. Ideally these would be using prof-o, on the condition that we still refer to prof-o as a suggestion not a formal recommendation (see the way it's been mentioned above). I reckon that some may find it more natural to have fully fledged</div>

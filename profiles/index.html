    <p>
      Builders of vocabularies and ontologies are encouraged to make their
      work as broadly applicable as possible so as to maximize future
      adoption. As a result, vocabularies and ontologies typically define a
      data model using minimal semantics. For example, DCAT [[vocab-dcat-2]] defines the
      concept of a <em>dataset</em> as an abstract entity with <em>distributions</em> and <em>data services</em>
      as means of accessing data. It is silent on whether a
      distribution should be in a particular serialization, or set of
      serializations; it is silent on how data services should be configured;
      while it states that the value of dcat:theme should be a SKOS concept,
      it does not specify a particular SKOS [[skos-reference]] concept scheme, and so on. Other
      vocabularies such as Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]] are equally parsimonious in their prescriptions of how they
      should be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is good practice: it means that data models and methods of working
      can be applied in different circumstances than those in which the original
      definition work was carried out and, in that sense, promotes broad
      interoperability.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, any individual system will be designed to meet a specific set
      of needs, that is, it will operate in a specific context. It is that
      context, and the individual choices made by the engineers working within
      it, that will determine how a vocabulary or set of vocabularies will be
      used. For example, a system ingesting data may require that a specific
      subset of properties from a range of vocabularies is used and that only
      terms from a defined code list are used as values for specified
      properties. In other words, where the 'base vocabulary' might say "the
      value of this property SHOULD be a value from a managed code list", a specialised <em>profile</em>
      will say "the value of this property MUST be from <em>this</em> specific code list."

      This document is about how to formulate and communicate <em>profiles</em>.

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      A <dfn>profile</dfn> is a named set of constraints on one or more identified base specifications,
      including the identification of any implementing subclasses of datatypes,
      semantic interpretations, vocabularies, options and parameters of those base specifications
      necessary to accomplish a particular function.

    <h2>Guidance for Profiles</h2>
    <p>
      This section lists, and then addresses, individual requirements that the Dataset Exchange Working Group
      considered important to address to define and work with profiles.

      <h3>Profile Description</h3>
      <p class="note">From F2F3 outline: What does profileDesc do?</p>
      <div class="requirement">
        <p class="reqTitle">Requirement</p>
        <p class="req">
          Profiles are "named collections of properties" or metadata terms (if not RDF) [ID41]

      </div>
      <div class="req-response">
        <p class="respTitle">Guidance</p>
        <p>This requirement implies that a profile is an identified resource that can be accessed, and hence MUST have a URI that resolves to a representation resource. This resource SHOULD be appropriate for the environment being profiled, but MAY be made available in alternative forms using negotiation.</p>
		<p>The ProfileDesc ontology is recommended for RDF based applications of profiles.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="requirement">
        <p class="reqTitle">Requirement</p>
        <p class="req">
          There needs to be a property in the profile where the rules for the descriptive content can be provided.
          This would apply to the entire profile. [ID42] (5.42) plenary-approved

        <p>
          Such a property requires a model for the <em>profile</em> and <em>rules</em> concepts and the predicate relating them. 
          An agreed vocabulary is required for interoperability.  In the absence of alternatives recommended by the W3C the ProfileDesc ontology is recommended for use with RDF encoded metadata. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that defined in this way, the rules for descriptive content may be formulated in a formal
          constraints language (such as [[SHACL]] or given in informal language, such as prose in a PDF document.

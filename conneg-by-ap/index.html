    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Content delivered by dereferencing Internet identifiers has long been able to be negotiated for in different
      ways. When using the HTTP protocol [[rfc7230]], a client may set an <code>Accept</code> header specifying
      preferred Media Types which the server may or may not supply. So too resources available in different languages
      may be requested by setting an HTTP <code>Accept-Language</code> header. Until now, clients have not had a
      defined way to negotiate for content based on its adherence to an information model - standard, specification or
      <a>profile</a> - and this document addresses that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When information online about a resource adheres to one or more profiles, methods described here allow
      clients to list those models adhered to and request content according to one or more of them in preference order.
      For example, information about a book online might adhere to the as the Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]] medatadata
      specifications with each field of information, such as <em>title</em>, <em>description</em>, <em>author</em> etc.,
      being defined and formatted according to various Dublin Core elements (<code>dct:title</code>,
      <code>dct:description</code> &amp; <code>dct:creator</code>, respectively). A request then for this book may ask for
      the list of profiles the book is available according to or it may ask specifically for a response adhering to the
      Dublin Core Terms profile. When a requested for a non-existent or unsupported profile is requested, a server
      returns default content.
    </p>
    <p>
      When selecting content negotiation mechanics, an Internet client may use the HTTP protocol but it may also use
      other methods for providing instructions to a server, such as URI Query String Arguments (QSAs). QSAs are long
      established as useful for humans and machines and in situations where negotiation via HTTP is not practical, such
      as when manually entering requests into web browsers. This document also provides guidance for non-HTTP methods
      of content negotiation and ensures they and the HTTP methods all adhere to a single functional specification
      which thus ensures their functional equivalency.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      In many cases, there are several ways to describe a resource within the scope of a single Media Type.
      For instance, XML documents, while conforming to the <code>text/xml</code> Media Type, may adhere to one of
      several DTDs or XML Schemas. RDF documents, with a choice of Media Type serialisations such as
      <code>text/turtle</code>, <code>application/rdf+xml</code> and others, have a very large number of vocabularies
      (classes and properties) available use for their content's information model. When a client initiates a request
      for an Internet resource, e.g., an HTTP GET to retrieve or a PUT to create or replace a resource, neither the
      client nor the server have yet had any standardised way to exchange information on how the transmitted resource
      will be structured precisely according to DTDs, XML Schema, vocabularies or other standards, specifications or
      <em>profiles</em>. When using non-HTTP content negotiation other methods, such as URIs with Query String
      Arguments, no universal or standardised method for doing this has been established although there are multiple
      specific ways this has been implemented previously, such as the OAI-PMH protocol [[OAI-PMH]].
    </p>
    <p>
      This document describes content negotiation based on profiles using HTTP protocol by introducing new headers and
      non-HTTP methods, such as via QSAs by introducing a general QSA Application Programming Interface (API).

    <h2>Abstract Model</h2>
    <p>
      This section describes an abstract conceptual model for content negotiation by profile, independent of any
      specific implementation - here termed realisations.
    </p>
    <section id="abstractmodelcontext">
      <h3>Context and terms</h3>
      <p>
        All content negotiation takes place between a <em>client</em> and a <em>server</em> over the Internet with the
        former requesting a representation of a <em>resource</em> or <em>resource</em>'s <em>metadata</em> through a 
        <em>request</em> and receiving it via a <em>response</em>. In some cases, a <em>server</em> may have to make a 
        <em>request</em> of a <em>client</em> and receive a <em>response</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Internet <em>resource</em> may have many aspects over which a <em>client</em>/<em>server</em> pair of
        agents might negotiate for content. These aspects are to be treated independently so content negotiation for a 
        resource involving negotiation by profile and potentially multiple other aspects of a resource will not affect
        each other. For this reason, other than a directive to maintain independence, no further discussion of 
        negotiation by profile and this relations to other forms of negotiation are given. Specific realisations might 
        require special handling of profile and other forms of negotiation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>client</em> <em>request</em>ing the representation of a <em>resource</em> conforming to a <a>profile</a>
        <a>must</a> identify the <em>resource</em> by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [[rfc3986]] and <a>must</a>
        identify a <a>profile</a> either by a URI or a <em>token</em> that unambiguously identifies the
        <a>profile</a> for the <em>server</em> within that <em>request</em>/<em>response</em> session.
      </p>
      <p>Definitions for the terms used above and below are:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>client</dt>
        <dd>an agent making a <em>request</em></dd>
      </dl>

      <dl>
        <dt>resource</dt>
        <dd>
          whatever might be identified by a URI. Familiar examples include an electronic
          document, an image, a source of information with a consistent purpose [[rfc3986]]

        In this abstract model, we don't assume any specifics about <em>client</em>, <em>server</em>, <em>resource</em>,

      <h3>Requests and Responses</h3>
      <p>
        There are two main types of <em>request</em> that a <em>client</em> might make of a <em>server</em> regarding
        content negotiation by profile. A <em>client</em> wishing to negotiate for content via profile adhering to this
        specification <a>must</a> be able to implement these two request types.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>list profiles</strong><br />
          a <em>client</em> requests the list of URIs for <a>profile</a>s a <em>server</em> is able to deliver
          <em>resource</em> representations conforming to
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>get resource by profile</strong>
          <br />a <em>client</em> requests a representation of the requested <em>resource</em> represented conforming
          to a particular <a>profile</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A third <em>request</em> type is given that is expected not to apply to all realisations of this abstract model
        and not all clients adhering to this specification need implement it.
      </p>
      <ol start="3">
        <li>
          <strong>list profiles tokens</strong><br />
          a <em>client</em> requests the list of <em>token</em>s the <em>server</em> uses for <a>profile</a>s a
          <em>server</em> is able to deliver <em>resource</em> representations conforming to and their mapping to
          <a>profile</a> URIs
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A <em>server</em> adhering to this specification <a>must</a> respond to each request with the following
        <em>response</em>s. The first two types are required, handling the third depends on the realisation environment.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>list profiles</strong><br />
          a <em>server</em> responds with the list of <a>profile</a> URIs for a <a>profile</a>s it is able to
          deliver <em>resource</em> representations conforming to, to a <em>client</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>get resource by profile</strong><br />
          a <em>server</em> responds with either a specific <a>profile</a> for a <em>resource</em> conforming to a
          requested <a>profile</a> identified by the <em>client</em> or a default <a>profile</a>

          particular <em>resource</em> representation is made or perhaps after an initial <em>request</em> for a
          <em>resource</em> representation is made.

        This section lists, and then addresses, individual requirements that the Dataset Exchange Working Group
        considered important for content negotiation by profile.

        <p>
          Responses to individual requirement Issues listed here are, at the time of the First Public Working Draft of
          this document, for demonstration only; to indicate the logic of answers to individual requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          These requirement responses may not survive in their current form in later drafts of this document nor may
          individual listings of requirements; they may be subsumed into the flowing txt of the document.

          This requirement is addressed by suggesting how an Internet resource in general, rather than specifically a
          <code>dcat:Dataset</code> or <code>dcat:Distribution</code> should list profiles it implements. A DCAT-
          specific solution should not be any different from the general case.
        </p>
        <div class="note" title="">Profile definition and constraints on properties are not addressed here. See
          [[PROF-GUIDE]].</div>
        <p>
          This requirement is taken to mean "create a way to list the profiles implemented by a Internet resource for
          <em>humans</em> and <em>machines</em> to use". For the former (humans), the options are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            discovery via HTML representation
            <ul>
              <li>see [[PROF-GUIDE]]</li>
              <li>an approach suggested is to provide an <em>alternate view</em> resource for the original
                resource located at <code>RESOURCE_URI + ?_view=alternates</code> which lists, at a minimum, the
                <em>profiles</em>, <em>media types</em> (formats) &amp; <em>languages</em> available, as per the
                <em>alternate views</em> guidance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="issue" data-number="392"></div>
        <p>For the latter (machines):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            discovery via HTTP
            <ul>
              <li>see [[PROF-IETF]]</li>
              <li>HTTP mechanics are described that allow clients to negotiate with servers for profile listings</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            discovery via RDF graph
            <ul>
              <li>see [[PROF-ONT]]</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          This requirement is the focus of the IETF RFC in the DXWG Family of Documents [[PROF-IETF]].
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, a series of new HTTP headers are added to the HTTP specification allowing for HTTP negotiation
          via profile in a manner similar to negotiation via Media Type or Language.

          The IETF submission in the DXWG Family of Documents [[PROF-IETF]] does not address content negotiaiton by
          profile query param patterns: it is limited to HTTP specification-based negotiation only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recommendations for content negotiation by profile via query param patterns (Query String Arguments) are
          given in the Profile Guidance [[PROF-GUIDE]] document where an API for this is defined.

          <em>(assuming wording of "a profile must have an identifier")</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Profiles must be identified by an HTTP URI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Short codes (tokens) for profiles that map to HTTP URIs for them may be used in systems that ensure the
          tokens map deterministically. This allows for the use of simple strings in places where URIs are impractical
          yet preserves the guarantee that every profile has an HTTP URI.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Content delivered by dereferencing Internet identifiers has long been able to be negotiated for in different
      ways. When using the HTTP protocol [[rfc7230]], a client may set an <code>Accept</code> header specifying
      preferred Media Types which the server may or may not supply. So too resources available in different languages
      may be requested by setting an HTTP <code>Accept-Language</code> header. Until now, clients have not had a
      defined way to negotiate for content based on its adherence to an information model - standard, specification or
      <em>profile</em> - and this document addresses that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When information online about a resource adheres to one or more profiles, methods described here allow
      clients to list those models adhered to and request content according to one or more of them in preference order.
      For example, information about a book online might adhere to the as the Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]] medatadata
      specifications with each field of information, such as <em>title</em>, <em>description</em>, <em>author</em> etc.,
      being defined and formatted according to various Dublin Core elements (<code>dct:title</code>,
      <code>dct:description</code> &amp; <code>dct:creator</code>, respectively). A request then for this book may ask for
      the list of profiles the book is available according to or it may ask specifically for a response adhering to the
      Dublin Core Terms profile. When a requested for a non-existent or unsupported profile is requested, a server
      returns default content.
    </p>
    <p>
      When selecting content negotiation mechanics, an Internet client may use the HTTP protocol but it may also use
      other methods for providing instructions to a server, such as URI Query String Arguments (QSAs). QSAs are long
      established as useful for humans and machines and in situations where negotiation via HTTP is not practical, such
      as when manually entering requests into web browsers. This document also provides guidance for non-HTTP methods
      of content negotiation and ensures they and the HTTP methods all adhere to a single functional specification
      which thus ensures their functional equivalency.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      In many cases, there are several ways to describe a resource within the scope of a single Media Type.
      For instance, XML documents, while conforming to the <code>text/xml</code> Media Type, may adhere to one of several
      DTDs or XML Schemas. RDF documents, with a choice of Media Type serialisations such as
      <code>text/turtle</code>, <code>application/rdf+xml</code> and others, have a very large number of vocabularies
      (classes and properties) available use for their content's information model. When a client initiates a request
      for an Internet resource, e.g., an HTTP GET to retrieve or a PUT to create or replace a resource, neither the
      client nor the server have yet had any standardised way to exchange information on how the transmitted resource will
      be structured precisely according to DTDs, XML Schema, vocabularies or other standards, specifications or
      <em>profiles</em>. When using non-HTTP content negotiation other methods, such as URIs with Query String Arguments, no universal or standardised method for doing
      this has been established although there are multiple specific ways this has been implemented previously, such as
      the OAI-PMH protocol [[OAI-PMH]].
    </p>
    <p>
      This document describes content negotiation based on profiles using HTTP protocol by introducing new headers and
      non-HTTP methods, such as via QSAs by introducing a general QSA Application Programming Interface (API).

    <h2>Related Work</h2>
    <p>
      What a <em>profile</em> is and how to create one is detailed in the [[PROF-GUIDE]] document created
      alongside this document, also by the Dataset Exchange Working Group (DXWG).
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessary standardisation of the content-negotiation HTTP headers is done within the IETF. A first proposal
      for an <a href="https://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Accept--Schema/I-D-accept-schema">Internet Draft
      for Negotiating Profiles in HTTP</a> [[PROF-IETF]] is available but has not yet been submitted to the IETF. The current
      version of the draft (-00) is expected to be completely re-written in course of the process and should not
      be seen as anything but work-in-progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Describing the parts of profiles and their relation to other profiles is done within the Profiles Ontology
      [[PROF-ONT]], also produced by the DXWG.

        considered important for content negotiation by profile.

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Responses to individual requirement Issues listed here are, at the time of the First Public Working Draft of
          this document, for demonstration only; to indicate the logic of answers to individual requirements.

        <p>
          This requirement is addressed by suggesting how an Internet resource in general, rather than specifically a
          <code>dcat:Dataset</code> or <code>dcat:Distribution</code> should list profiles it implements. A DCAT-
          specific solution should not be any different from the general case.
        </p>
        <div class="note" title="">Profile definition and constraints on properties are not addressed here. See
          [[PROF-GUIDE]].</div>
        <p>
          This requirement is taken to mean "create a way to list the profiles implemented by a Internet resource for
          <em>humans</em> and <em>machines</em> to use". For the former (humans), the options are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            discovery via HTML representation
            <ul>
              <li>see [[PROF-GUIDE]]</li>
              <li>an approach suggested is to provide an <em>alternate view</em> resource for the original
                resource located at <code>RESOURCE_URI + ?_view=alternates</code> which lists, at a minimum, the
                <em>profiles</em>, <em>media types</em> (formats) &amp; <em>languages</em> available, as per the
                <em>alternate views</em> guidance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="issue" data-number="392"></div>
        <p>For the latter (machines):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            discovery via HTTP
            <ul>

          This requirement is the focus of the IETF RFC in the DXWG Family of Documents [[PROF-IETF]].
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, a series of new HTTP headers are added to the HTTP specification allowing for HTTP negotiation
          via profile in a manner similar to negotiation via Media Type or Language.

          The IETF submission in the DXWG Family of Documents [[PROF-IETF]] does not address profile negotiation by
          query param patterns: it is limited to HTTP specification-based negotiation only.

        <p>
          Recommendations for profile negotiation via query param patterns (Query String Arguments) are given in the

          Short codes (tokens) for profiles that map to HTTP URIs for them may be used in systems that ensure the

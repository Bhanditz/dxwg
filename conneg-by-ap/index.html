      This document is part of a family of documents giving guidance on profiling. Some of the documents are general
      while some are technology-specific. Please consult the Profile Guidance [[PROF-GUIDE]] document for an
      overview of all documents. It is the recommended starting point.

  <section id="Introduction">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Internet clients may wish to request that the content of a requested Internet resource adheres to a particular
      standard, specification or <em>profile</em>. This is distinct from the content being formatted according to a
      particular serialization or Media Type, such as HTML, one of the many forms of RDF or perhaps XML. Instead, this
      sort of adherence relates to the parts of the content and their concepts adhering to information or conceptual
      models. For example, information about a book may adhere to the Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]] medatadata
      specifications with each field of information, such as <em>title</em>, <em>description</em>, <em>author</em> etc.,
      being defined according to various Dublin Core elements (<code>dct:title</code>, <code>dct:description</code>
      &amp; <code>dct:creator</code>, respectively).
    </p>
    <p>
      The content delivered by dereferencing Internet identifiers has long been able to be negotiated for in different
      ways. When using the HTTP protocol [[rfc7230]], a client may set an <code>Accept</code> header specifying
      preferred Media Types which the server may or may not supply. So too resources in different languages may be
      requested by setting an HTTP <code>Accept-Language</code> header. Until now, clients have not had a defined way
      to negotiate for content based on information model standard, specification or <em>profile</em> and this
      document addresses that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When selecting content negotiation mechanics, an Internet client may use the HTTP protocol but it also may not:
      methods for providing instructions to a server such as Query String Arguments (QSAs) are long established as
      useful for humans, machines and in situations where negotiation via HTTP is not best applicable. This document
      provides guidance for non-HTTP methods of content negotiation to ensure that they align with HTTP method thus
      ensuring their functional equivalency.

      necessary to accomplish a particular function.

  <section id="Motivation">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      In many cases, there are several ways to describe a resource within the scope of a single Media Type.
      For instance, XML documents, while conforming to the <code>text/xml</code> Media Type may adhere to one of several
      DTDs or XML Schemas, whereas RDF documents (with a choice of Media Type serialisations such as
      <code>text/turtle</code> and even XML, <code>application/rdf+xml</code>) have a very large number of vocabularies
      (classes and properties) available use for their content's information model. When a client initiates a request
      for an Internet resource, e.g., an HTTP GET to retrieve or a PUT to create or replace a resource, neither the
      client nor the server have yet had any possibility to exchange information on how the transmitted resource will
      be structured precisely according to DTDs, XML Schema or, vocabularies or other standards, specifications or
      <em>profiles</em>. When using other methods such as QSAs, no universal or general standardised method for doing
      this has been established although there are multiple specific ways this has been implemented previously, such as
      the OAI-PMH protocol [[OAI-PMH]].
    </p>
    <p>
      This document describes content negotiation based on profiles using HTTP protocol by introducing new headers and
      non-HTTP methods, such as via QSAs by introducing a general QSA Aplication Programming Interface (API).

    <h2>Related Work</h2>
    <p>
      The necessary standardisation of the content-negotiation headers is done within the IETF. A first proposal
      for an <a href="https://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Accept--Schema/I-D-accept-schema">Internet Draft
      for Negotiating Profiles in HTTP</a> is available but has not yet been submitted to the IETF. The current
      version of the draft (-00) is expected to be completely re-written in course of the process and should not
      be seen as anything but work-in-progress.

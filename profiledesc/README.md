# DXWG's Profile Descriptor
This component of the [Data Exchange Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/)'s code repository is for work on the *Profile Descriptor* task.

## Profiles Description Ontology
Currently (May, 2018), an ontology to describe objects relevant to profiling (original specifications profiled, profiles of profiles, categorisation of profiling methods, validation resources etc.) has been created. See:

* [Profiledesc Documentation](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiledesc/profiledesc) - ontology description as a web page
* [profiledesc.ttl](profiledesc.ttl) - ontology source (RDF, turtle)
* [profiledesc.png](profiledesc.png) - ontology overview diagram

### Examples
The [examples](examples/) folder contains a series of scenarios of the Profiles Description Ontology being used to model existing and likely future profiling situations.

## Next Steps
The DXWG has yet, as of the start of May 2018, not decided how it will address its original charter deliverable to provide **profile guidance**. Once a decision has been made, work here will be folded into that initiative.

## Contact
Primary contact for this documentation of the Profiles Description Ontology is:

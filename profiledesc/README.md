# DXWG's Profile Descriptor

This component of the [Data Exchange Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/)'s code repository is for work on the *Profile Descriptor* task.

## Profiles Description Ontology
Currently (April, 2018), an ontology to describe objects relevant to profiling (original specifications profiled, profiles of profiles, categorisation of profiling methods) has been created. See [profile.ttl](profile.ttl) in this folder for the source and <https://promsns.org/def/prof> for a demo of the ontology documented in HTML. Additionally, the main classes and their relations are shown in a diagram [profiledesc.png](profiledesc.png).

## Next Steps
The DXWG has yet, as of April 2018, not decided how it will address its original charter deliverable to provide **profile guidance**. Once a decision has been made (likely May, 2018) work here will be folded into that initiative.

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-vocab-dcat-20140116/">original Recommendation</a>, published in January 2014, provided the basic framework for describing datasets. Importantly, it made the distinction between a dataset as an abstract idea and a distribution as a manifestation of it. Although DCAT has been widely adopted, it has became clear that the original lacked a number of essential features that were added either through application profiles, such as the European Commission's DCAT-AP [[DCAT-AP]], or the development of larger vocabularies that to a greater or lesser extent built upon the base standard, such as the Healthcare and Life Sciences Community Profile [[HCLS-Dataset]], the Data Tag Suite [[DATS]] and more. This version of DCAT has been developed to identify and address the specific shortcomings that have come to light through the experiences of different communities, the aim being, of course, to improve interoperability between them.</p>
